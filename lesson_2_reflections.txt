What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A .git folder is created in the current working directory. It is needed for git to keep track of the files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Working directory is where you keep all the files. Repository is a snapshot of version that you commit. Staging area is the intermediate between working directory and repository. You can choose what changes and what to commit to add into staging area.
